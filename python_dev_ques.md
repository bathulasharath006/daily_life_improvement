### 1. What is your most preferred language? Why?
**Answer:**
- **Python**
- **Versatility**: Python supports multiple paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.  
- **Readability**: Python's clean and concise syntax enhances code readability and maintainability.  
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Extensive libraries and frameworks make it suitable for web development, data science, machine learning, and automation.  
- **Cross-Platform**: Python runs on various operating systems without modification.  
- **Strong Community**: A large, active community ensures continuous improvement, extensive documentation, and third-party support.  
- **Rapid Development**: Python's simplicity enables faster development cycles, making it ideal for prototyping and production applications.  
- **Easy To Debug**
- **Automation & Scripting**: Python excels in automating repetitive tasks and system scripting.  
- **Integration**: It seamlessly integrates with C, C++, Java, and other languages, enhancing interoperability.

### 2. Some keys points about Python.
**Answer:**
- **Python is an interpreted language**: It is not compiled, reads 1 line at a time during runtime and executes on the flow.
- **High-Level programming language**: It manages memory for us, easy to read - human readable, works on any system - no architecture compatibility issues.
- **Dynamically Typed**: It means data type of a variable is determined only during runtime && No need to declare variable types explicitly.  
- **Interpreted Language**: Executes code line by line, making debugging easier.  
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatic memory management via reference counting and cyclic garbage collection.  
- **Extensive Libraries**: Includes NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Flask, Django, etc., for various applications.  
- **Object-Oriented**: Supports OOP principles like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.  
- **Multi-Paradigm**: Supports procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming.  
- **Platform Independent**: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more with minimal changes.  
- **Strong Community Support**: One of the largest programming communities with extensive documentation.  
- **Easy Integration**: Can integrate with C, C++, Java, and other languages.  
- **Concurrency Support**: Provides multithreading and multiprocessing for parallel execution.

### 3. What is meant by Python being an interpreted language?
**Answer:**
- **Interpreter** runs the code line by line and not compiling into machine code first.  
- **Line-by-Line Execution**: Python executes code one line at a time, making debugging easier.  
- **No Compilation Step**: Unlike compiled languages (C, C++), Python does not require a separate compilation phase.  
- **Platform Independence**: The same Python script can run on different operating systems without modification.  
- **Slower Execution**: Interpreted languages are generally slower than compiled ones due to runtime interpretation.  
- **Interactive Execution**: Python allows running code interactively using the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop).  
- **Dynamic Typing**: Variable types are determined at runtime instead of during compilation.  
- **Bytecode Compilation**: Python first converts source code into bytecode (`.pyc` files) before execution by the interpreter.  
- **Portability**: Python programs can run on any system with a compatible interpreter without recompilation.

### 4. Give three differences between Lists and Tuples
**Answer:**
- **Mutability** - Lists are mutable where as tuples are immutable.
- **Memory Usage** - A List occupies more memory than tuple.
- **Performance** - List has slower iteration compared to tuples. But it is better for insertion and deletion operations due to its mutability.
- **Syntax** - Lists use square Brackets where as Tuples use Parentheses.

### 5. Differentiate between mutable and immutable data types or What is mutability?
**Answer:**
- **Mutability Definition**: A mutable object can be modified after creation, whereas an immutable object cannot be changed.  
- **Mutable Types**: Lists, dictionaries, sets, and bytearrays allow in-place modification.  
- **Immutable Types**: Strings, tuples, integers, floats, and frozensets cannot be changed after creation.  
- **Memory Efficiency**: Immutable objects are more memory-efficient and safer for hash-based structures like dictionary keys.  
- **Performance**: Mutable objects may have performance overhead due to dynamic resizing, while immutable objects are optimized for speed.  
- **Example (Mutable)**: `list1 = [1, 2, 3]; list1[0] = 10  # Allowed`  
- **Example (Immutable)**: `tuple1 = (1, 2, 3); tuple1[0] = 10  # Error`.
